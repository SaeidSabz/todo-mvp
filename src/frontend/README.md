### Running the Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)

The frontend is a Vite + React + TypeScript application located under `src/frontend`.

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed  
  Check versions:
      node --version
      npm --version

#### How to run the frontend

From the repository root:

    cd src/frontend/src
    npm install
    npm run dev

The app will start on a local development server, typically:

    http://localhost:5173

At this stage of the Walking Skeleton, the frontend displays:
- A main title: "To-Do Task Management MVP"
- A confirmation that the frontend is running
- A placeholder section that will later show the backend API status
